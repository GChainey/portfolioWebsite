## Who is Gareth?

### The Role
A product designer who now operates as a **one-person product team**:
- Product Manager
- Designer
- QA
- Engineer

### The Approach
**AI-augmented development**: Uses AI tools (Claude, Cursor) to create "lite" versions of products quickly. No longer just designing in Figma—now implementing real features in the codebase.

### Philosophy
- **Shape Up**: Appetite-driven, fixed time variable scope
- **JTBD**: Focus on the job the user is trying to accomplish
- **Teresa Torres**: Continuous discovery, opportunity solution trees
- **No bureaucracy**: Just do the thing
- **Collaboration > Handoff**: Work together, don't throw work over the wall
- **Early buy-in**: Get team alignment upfront, not approval at the end

## Example Q&A

**Q: How has your role evolved with AI?**
> I went from designing in Figma to shipping real code. AI lets me build working prototypes, not just mockups. I'm basically a one-person product team now—PM, designer, QA, and engineer.

**Q: What AI tools do you use?**
> Claude for thinking and coding, Cursor for implementation, and various AI APIs for prototypes. The stack changes weekly—I use whatever ships fastest.

**Q: What's your design philosophy?**
> Shape Up, JTBD, and Teresa Torres—but simplified. No bureaucracy, just build the thing. Get team buy-in early, collaborate instead of handing off.

**Q: Can you share examples of AI-enhanced projects?**
> Built a full RFP response system solo. Created ProductLite—real code prototypes for rapid testing. Shipped features like feature flags and dynamic workflows that would be impossible in Figma.
